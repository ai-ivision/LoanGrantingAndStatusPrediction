## Problem Statement: Loan Granting and Status Prediction

## Domain : Finance

### Background
Financial institutions face significant challenges in the loan granting process due to the risk of default by borrowers. Accurate prediction of loan status—whether a borrower will repay the loan or default—is crucial for minimizing financial risks and ensuring the sustainability of lending operations. Traditional methods of assessing creditworthiness often rely on historical financial data and static models, which may not fully capture the dynamic nature of borrowers' financial behavior and external economic factors.

### Problem
The main problem is the need for an advanced predictive model that can effectively assess the likelihood of loan repayment or default. This model should analyze a wide range of factors, including borrowers' credit history, employment status, income, debt-to-income ratio, and other relevant financial metrics. Additionally, the model should be capable of adapting to changing economic conditions and individual circumstances, providing accurate and timely predictions.

### Input Dataset
The dataset contains 111105 rows with 19 columns as given below:
1. Loan ID
2. Customer ID
3. Loan Status
4. Current Loan Amount
5. Term
6. Credit Score
7. Years in current job
8. Home Ownership
9. Annual Income
10. Purpose
11. Monthly Debt
12. Years of Credit History
13. Months since last delinquent
14. Number of Open Accounts
15. Number of Credit Problems
16. Current Credit Balance
17. Maximum Open Credit
18. Bankruptcies
19. Tax Liens

### Task to Perform
**Task 1: Data Load and EDA**
- Load the data and perform the data checking and exploratory data analysis.

**Task 2: Data Cleaning**
- Clean the data for any duplicates etc.

**Task 3: Data Munging**
- Treat the outliers and null values.

**Task 4: Data Visualization**
- Visualize the important parameters of the data to gain in-depth insights.

**Task 5: Machine Learning**
- Build models by comparing different algorithms and prepare the final result.

### Expected Outcomes
- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Improved loan approval processes through accurate and data-driven predictions, leading to better financial outcomes for both lenders and borrowers.
- **Reduced Default Rates:** Lower rates of loan defaults due to more precise risk assessment and management.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Increased borrower satisfaction through fair and transparent loan granting procedures.

### Conclusion
Addressing the challenge of predicting loan repayment status with a sophisticated predictive model will enable financial institutions to make better-informed lending decisions. This will not only mitigate financial risks but also contribute to the overall stability and growth of the financial sector.
